                Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that 
                of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest
                natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus. People have been observing it since prehistoric times; it was named after the 
                Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods, because of its observed size.

                Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes one-quarter of its mass and one-tenth of its volume. It likely has a rocky core 
                of heavier elements, but, like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. The ongoing contraction of its interior 
                generates heat greater than the amount received from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is an oblate spheroid; it has a 
                slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, with turbulence 
                and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm known to have existed since at least 
                the 17th century when telescopes first saw it.

                Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter's magnetic tail is nearly 800 million km (5.3 AU; 500 million mi) 
                long, covering the entire distance to Saturn's orbit. Jupiter has 80 known moons and possibly many more, including the four large Galilean moons discovered 
                by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Io and Europa are about the size of Earth's Moon; Callisto is almost the size of the planet
                 Mercury, and Ganymede is even larger.

                Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its closest approach to the planet in December 1973. Jupiter has since been explored on several
                 occasions by robotic spacecraft, beginning with the Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions from 1973 to 1979, and later by the Galileo orbiter, which arrived at 
                 Jupiter in 1995. In 2007, the New Horizons visited Jupiter using its gravity to increase its speed, bending its trajectory en route to Pluto. The latest 
                 probe to visit the planet, Juno, entered orbit around Jupiter in July 2016. Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable 
                 ice-covered liquid ocean of Europa.

            <h1 style="color:black" font-style="bold">Formation and migration</h1>
            <p>
                Jupiter is most likely the oldest planet in the Solar System. Current models of Solar System formation suggest that Jupiter formed at or beyond the snow line; 
                a distance from the early Sun where the temperature is sufficiently cold for volatiles such as water to condense into solids. It first assembled a large solid 
                core before accumulating its gaseous atmosphere. As a consequence, the core must have formed before the solar nebula began to dissipate after 10 million years. 
                Formation models suggest Jupiter grew to 20 times the mass of the Earth in under a million years. The orbiting mass created a gap in the disk, thereafter slowly 
                increasing to 50 Earth masses in 3–4 million years.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to the "grand tack hypothesis", Jupiter would have begun to form at a distance of roughly 3.5 AU (520 million km; 330 million mi). As the young planet 
                accreted mass, interaction with the gas disk orbiting the Sun and orbital resonances with Saturn caused it to migrate inward. This would have upset the 
                orbits of what are believed to be super-Earths orbiting closer to the Sun, causing them to collide destructively. Saturn would later have begun to migrate inwards too,
                 much faster than Jupiter, leading to the two planets becoming locked in a 3:2 mean motion resonance at approximately 1.5 AU (220 million km; 140 million mi). 
                 This, in turn, would have changed the direction of migration, causing them to migrate away from the Sun and out of the inner system to their current locations.These 
                 migrations would have occurred over an 800,000-year time period, with all of this happening over a time period of up to 6 million years after Jupiter began to form 
                 (3 million being a more likely figure). This departure would have allowed the formation of the inner planets from the rubble, including Earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the formation timescales of terrestrial planets resulting from the grand tack hypothesis appear inconsistent with the measured terrestrial composition.Moreover, 
                the likelihood that the outward migration actually occurred in the solar nebula is very low. In fact, some models predict the formation of Jupiter's analogues whose 
                properties are close to those of the planet at the current epoch.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other models have Jupiter forming at distances much further out, such as 18 AU (2.7 billion km; 1.7 billion mi). In fact, based on Jupiter's composition, researchers 
                have made the case for an initial formation outside the molecular nitrogen (N2) snowline, which is estimated at 20–30 AU (3.0–4.5 billion km; 1.9–2.8 billion mi),and possibly 
                even outside the argon snowline, which may be as far as 40 AU (6.0 billion km; 3.7 billion mi). Having formed at one of these extreme distances, Jupiter would then have 
                migrated inwards to its current location. This inward migration would have occurred over a roughly 700,000-year time period, during an epoch approximately 2–3 million
                 years after the planet began to form. Saturn, Uranus and Neptune would have formed even further out than Jupiter, and Saturn would also have migrated inwards.
